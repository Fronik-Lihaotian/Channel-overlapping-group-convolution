# <center> Channel-Overlapping group convolution: a simple yet effective design for lightweight CNNs

### author: Haotian Li

This is my MSC final project which mainly presented an innovative group convolution to further decrease the computational cost of Inverted Residual Block. 

Channel-overlapping group convolution is easy to implement and aims to replace the original pointwise convolution within the inverted residual block to diminish the cost of channel expansion. The details are presented in my research [thesis](hxl226/MSc%20final%20project.pdf). 

This repository is used to save my project only, there may be many deficiencies in the code and paper, apologize for that if you're interested in this project but found it hard to read :worried:. I may refine this repository in the future, but not guaranteed.
